# AI and intelligent automation in aerospace applications  
## Abstract  
The current air traffic control (ATC) system is designed for heavy human controller
reliance. While air travel demands are climbing rapidly, limitations in both ATC
capacity and supported technologies would sooner or later pose an enormous problem
in excessive controllers’ workload. Exploiting AI and intelligent automation is
an approach to reduce the workload pressure but still maintain or even increase
the airspace’s safety level. In this thesis, problems and benefits of controlling air
traffic with a higher automation level are analyzed to evaluate the automatization
idea’s feasibility. Up-to-date developed and developing automated systems to avoid
aerospace collisions, such as TCAS and ASAS, are also reviewed to provide a
general sight of technology applications at present or in the near future. Finally,
the thesis presents several directions to automatically solve existing air traffic
problems using AI techniques in recent studies.
